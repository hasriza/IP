			<p>This is an initiative that is designed beautifully to make sure that used Tetra Pak cartons are recycled into useful things for the society, especially for lesser privileged children. Not only can we help build a cleaner India, but a smarter India too.</p>
			<p>What good is a campaign, but for the stories of it's campaigners. Here are some!</p>

			<p>“My parents are social workers. They’ve dedicated their lives to underprivileged kids––they run a school for them. When I was a child, many of my father’s students would stay with us at home, and my mom would feed them. I grew up watching them take care of people…they nurtured these kids and helped them grow in life. I wanted to carry their values forward.
			B. Ed was the most obvious route for me. But I knew there was something missing. I began going for nature walks to pass the time and I ended up with a connection to all that was around me – the trees, plants, animals. 
			That’s when I realized that the future generations don’t really know anything about how we’re damaging our world––I was getting to know about it so late in life myself! So when I finished my studies, I co-founded a school for underprivileged kids––one that teaches them to be proactive and sensitized. 
			I wanted my kids to learn something more than just what they see in textbooks––so here, at Rishi Valmiki Eco School, we have a wildlife syllabus as well! Perspective is so important––and they’ve opened their minds to it! A few of my students even conduct nature walks for adults now.
			I’m trying to build a greener generation. And I can see the change – we have a child who’s recently transferred here from another school. He’s adapted really well! But to our surprise his mom came to complain about him. She said that he now picks up trash from the road to throw in his dustbin at home. Honestly, that’s the best complaint I’ve heard in a long time!
			And there’s so much more we want to do…but a lack of funds always stops us. We can barely cover the teacher’s salaries here sometimes. So when Tetra Pak donated 15 benches which were made from recycled material, it really helped a lot. Not only because it gave the kids a place to study, but also because they were eco-friendly just like our school! Our motto is simple, ‘Keep it all clean – your thoughts, your home, your world, your heart.’”

			<p>“I was 13 when I started teaching my friends Math in school. I realised then that I really enjoyed it and wanted to do more, so I started volunteering with an NGO in Dharavi. Every week, I would go teach underprivileged kids. But, I started noticing that my students were skipping out on their classes more and more because they were falling sick. On asking them about it, I learnt that they spent most of their days working in landfills and it was affecting their health. It was heart-breaking.
			Even when I went to Alibaug with my grandparents to visit the beach -- each and every one of them was polluted. There was waste thrown around everywhere! I got frustrated because there was no place to escape to. When I started noticing these small things, I wished to do something about it. Not just for me, but for everyone around that was being affected and had no clue about it.
			An idea struck when I learned about recycling. I started at home to see if I could at least reduce the amount of waste that we were contributing to these areas. I taught all the domestic staff in my building how to recycle. And soon, we successfully reduced the amount of waste we were sending to the dumps from 200 kgs per day to 50 kgs per day! Then, I came across Tetra Pak’s initiative. We could recycle their cartons and actually donate them to make classroom furniture! I could kill two birds with one stone… reduce waste and give students better facilities to study! So, I started teaching all the staff in my building and community how to clean and recycle these cartons -- since then 250 desks have been donated... that too through waste!
			Sometimes, all it takes is one small step."

			<p>“I’m from a Navy family, so we moved around a lot. But my favourite places so far have been Ooty and the Naval residence in Mumbai. Ooty has been beautiful because of its lush valleys, waterfalls, witnessing wild elephants in the neighbouring hills; but even in Mumbai I was always around nature. I lived in a residential area that was beautiful and cared for by the community. 
			When I was a kid, my dad used to take my sister and I to his ancestral village in Haryana in our summer vacations. We would uproot carrots from the ground, pluck sugarcanes, swim with buffaloes in the little ponds there and even ride on tractors. Honestly, exploring so many different parts of India was the best thing about my childhood.
			And I don’t know what it was, maybe the strict rules and etiquettes that comes with a Navy background, or just the environment I grew up in -- but I was always very conscious of my habits. Whether it was saving electricity or separating my garbage, I made an effort to do the right thing. 
			After I won Miss India in 2011 and started travelling for work, I began noticing the differences in the environment and systems of India. There was so much more we needed to do for our country. So, when I came back, I continued recycling and was always proud of the fact that I had built on a wonderful habit that I picked up abroad. It was my own little way of giving back -- because we must take care of the land we live on...we can’t take it for granted! 
			I met with Tetra Pak earlier this year and they told me that if we return the empty cartons to collection centres, a lot of useful things can be made from them -- desks, notebooks and roofing sheets. Which in turn, gets donated to schools that need them. I entered the meeting as a conscious citizen and left as their Green Champion -- I got involved with making people aware of this recycling program. And I can’t think of a better way to begin making a simple yet wonderful change.”

			<p>“All I knew was that I wanted to become an engineer, and I wanted to make a difference to my country. So, after I got a degree from Stanford University, I returned to India. 
			At first, I worked in my father’s company. But I didn’t know when or how I would begin making that ‘difference’ -- It was only when I had my first daughter and she started to get sick, that I became more conscious of our environment. And I reached the peak of frustration when I visited my farm house in Gujarat -- the one place that used to be so clean and green was now completely covered in waste and pollution. There was no place left to escape to anymore. 
			I had to start somewhere -- so I started with recycling.
			I learned how to compost my waste from home -- turns out, I could grow a melon out of it in my very own terrace garden! That’s when the idea struck -- if just a little recycling could give me so much, imagine if we recycled more!
			I heard about Tetra Pak cartons and that they could be recycled into classroom furniture, notebooks and even roofing sheets! All I had to do was save the cartons and return them for recycling. But I wanted to do more. That’s when I started working with Tetra Pak on their recycling projects. It’s been 8 years and we’ve collected tons of cartons from all over the city and recycled them into classroom desks and benches. My happiest moment was when we donated desks to a school where the kids have never known a classroom with actual desks before. Just the smiles and the excitement on their faces was worth it. Not only am I happy that I’m not adding to the city’s waste, but I am excited to give back to the society. This is what I had envisioned all along – to do something meaningful – and now I’m helping build better India!” #CartonsLeAao #ClassroomBanao.

			<p>"I lost my father early on. I watched my mother take over the responsibility of the household and bring us up. She sold vegetables every day and worked night and day to educate us. She wanted us to make something of ourselves so we’d never have to struggle.
			I developed my work ethic because of her– I went from an account clerk, to working in mills. Even after I was married, I didn’t stop working– it’s all I knew and together, my husband and I built a life for our family.
			<!-- Unfortunately, the company my husband worked for shut down– he couldn’t find a job, and the responsibility of our three children fell on my shoulders. I began to work more while my husband took over the household. People started talking about us, but I was confident that we would figure something out.
			And soon enough, we set up a business of selling milk together. Because I had more time on my hands, so I started working with an NGO, my role was to give employment to waste-pickers. I worked out of their office, near a dumping ground– the smell was horrible.
			Co-incidentally, in 2008, a Tetra Pak Manager came to our office and showed us a demo of how Tetra Pak cartons can be recycled and reused instead of being thrown away in these dumps. Something clicked in me- I wanted to do anything to help these waste-pickers, especially if it meant reducing the amount of waste, and helping them earn some extra money.
			So, I started going around and collecting these cartons. No one cared enough– but I kept trying to tell them how important it was to recycle. Over time, more people became aware and the donations increased.
			Since then, I’ve collected over 50 tonnes of Tetra Pak cartons and sent them for recycling. This is in addition to me running my business–– so all you need is the will to do it!
			I’m an ordinary woman– I run my house, the business with my husband, work hard towards the cause of improving waste-pickers’ lives and I’m happy”.  -->
